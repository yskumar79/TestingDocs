Lookup a definition
Narrative:
In order to do Mathematics better
As an Maths student
I want to look up math word definitions

Scenario: Looking up the definition of 'cosine'
Given the user is on the Wikionary home page
When the user looks up the definition of the word 'cosine'
Then they should see the definition 'In a right triangle, the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to an acute angle to the length of the hypotenuse.'
